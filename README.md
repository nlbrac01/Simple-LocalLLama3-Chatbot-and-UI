The provided code is a simple application that uses the Langchain library to interact with an LLM - in this case, Llama3. Streamlit is used for creating the user interface.

Chain Object Explained
---------------------------------
The ‘chain’ object in this code is an instance of a Langchain Chain, which is a way to combine multiple components (like prompts and models) into a 
cohesive pipeline. In this case, it combines a ChatPromptTemplate (which structures the system message and user question), an LLM (the Llama3 model from Ollama), and an 
output parser that formats the LLM’s response as a string.

When ‘chain.invoke({“question”:input_text})’ is called, it takes the input text, applies the prompt template to structure the question for the LLM, sends this to the LLM, 
receives the response, and then parses this response into a string that can be displayed in the Streamlit interface. This makes it easy to manage complex interactions between 
different components of a larger system.
